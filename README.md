Title : Search Doc

Feature :
        My project is aimed at providing options to the users where they will be able to search and find the health providers in their area.
Benefit:
* My project attempts to solve one of the common problems which is to find out if a specific doctor accepts users insurance without calling the         doctors office.
* It allows users to save there favorite doctor details to the profile page.
